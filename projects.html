                                        This is where you can find all my projects (that I've documented and uploaded at least).
                                        I'll try to group them according to the general nature of the project, but many of them span multiple sections and will be listed under each of them.

                                        The difference between this and my github is that I'll try to describe the development process here.
                                        Then you can see the ideas I had and pitfalls I had to avoid to achieve them.
