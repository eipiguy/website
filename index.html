                        <p>Welcome to my page! Starting this up from scratch, so bear with me as content is filled in and formatting is streamlined. If you want to see how the process is going and how I'm accomplishing things, check out the "Projects" section.</p>
                        <p>Generally, all my current and past projects will be found in that section, and I'll try to keep things updated as best as possible.</p>
                        <p>If you're looking for what I use to do anything, check out the "Workspace" page. I'll show you my favorite programs, plugins, and hardware. I'll also give you a look at the physical tools I use, and how I set up my space as I work on non-digital projects.</p>
